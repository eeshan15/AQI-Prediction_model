## Project Overview

Air quality has a significant impact on public health, and predicting AQI can help communities prepare for hazardous conditions. This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict AQI using various data preprocessing and modeling techniques.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values using advanced imputation techniques.
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- Selection of the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values in the dataset were filled using the MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) technique. This was implemented using the Iterative Imputer from scikit-learn with Ridge, Elastic Net, and Bayesian Regression as estimators.
  
- **Data Visualization:** Data insights and visual patterns were explored using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were tested to find the best performing one:

- **Random Forest (Selected Model):** Performed best among all models.
- **XGBoost**
- **Gradient Boosting**

The Random Forest model was selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and RÂ² score.
